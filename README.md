ðŸ”¹ Bitcoin's Wild Ride

ðŸ“ˆ High: $63,503 (2021)

ðŸ“‰ Low: $68.43 (2013)

ðŸ§¾ Current Price (as of July 2021): $34,235

Despite a -46% drop from the peak, BTC still commands the market with the highest average daily volume (~10.9K).

ðŸ”¹ Top Performers (Past Year)

ðŸ¥‡ DOGE: +89% growth ðŸš€

ðŸ¥ˆ SOL: +47%

ðŸ¥‰ BNB: +19%
These altcoins have outperformed most, showing strong traction in a volatile market.

ðŸ”¹ Worst Performers (30 Days)

DOT, EOS, and DOGE all saw declines exceeding -30%, reflecting recent market corrections.

ðŸ”¹ Volatility Remains a Theme

XRP saw a massive spike (365d high: $1,260) but now trades at $0.67 (ðŸ“‰ -95%).

High volatility = high risk + opportunity.

ðŸ”¹ Correlations Worth Watching

USDC and USDT show near-perfect correlation (=1.00), typical for stablecoins.

BTCâ€™s price correlation with others like ETH (0.60) and BNB (0.31) hints at mid-level dependency in broader trends.

ðŸ’¡ Takeaway: The crypto market continues to evolve â€” while Bitcoin remains dominant, emerging tokens like SOL and DOGE show promising momentum. Diversification, risk awareness, and timing remain key.
